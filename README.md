# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this assignment was polish our existing Mission to Mars web page and make it more user friendly. The goal is also to add four hemisphere images and somewhat customize the webpage as well. BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
